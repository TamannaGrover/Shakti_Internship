<br>ðŸš€**This repository includes all the work I did towards Shakti Microprocessor in R.I.S.E Lab in IIT Madras under Dr. V. Kamakoti and Kotteeswaran Ekambaram sir during May-August 2024.**<br>
<br>ðŸš€Over the time, adapting from successful compilation of ***sifiveu*** (RiscV board), I will reciprocate similar architecture for Shakti.<br>

<br>The current files contain changes in shakti as a separate folder. Later, I will make changes in main makefile to configure shakti as new target board. Wokring on in-code changes right now.<br>

<br>Steps to be followed:<br>
<br>1. Study the documentation for openWRT and analyze the requirements for a new target. <br>
<br>2. Observe pre-existing targets and their configuration.<br>
<br>3. Upon completion of that, we can try cross-compiling another RISCV-based board (Having already done that, I have moved onto the next step.<br>
<br>4. Starting from basic changes in configuration file, changing essential features in makefile, and the main architecture in base files for successful gdb read. <br>
<br>5. Upon compilation, we can map it to the hardware and try running it on the board. Thereafter, communication protocols can be utilised to allow testing of the built architecture also.<br>
<br>6. Done :) (We cannot ever reach this step while in the field of research hehe ;p)<br>
